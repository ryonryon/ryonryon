### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Full Stack Developer with 6 years of professional experience. I have a great passion for writing readable and maintainable code. As a developer, we are using more time to read the code instead of writing a code so I believe that writing a descriptive and easy to understand code makes our development process faster and and effective. Another thing I truly care about is I always use a collaborative communication and a cheerful, positive approach to discuss properly with whom I'm working with.
